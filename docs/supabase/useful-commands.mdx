## Supabase CLI Setup (macOs) (optional)

Install the CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install supabase
```

## Supabase Commands

You can either use preset commands `pnpm run supabase:<command>` or call supabase directly if you have CLI installed `supabase <command>`.

### Start Supabase

```
pnpm run supabase:start
```

### Stop Supabase

```
pnpm run supabase:stop
```

### Generate TypeScript Types

Whenever you make changes to your database schema, you need to regenerate the types.

```
pnpm run supabase:types
```

This will generate the types based on your Supabase schema and save them to `types/db.ts`.

### Restart Supabase

If you make changes to config.toml you need to restart supabase for the changes to take effect.

```
pnpm run supabase:restart
```

Stops and then starts the local Supabase development environment.

### Reset Supabase Database

Useful if you want to reset the database to its initial state.
Wipes the database and runs the seed file and migrations.

```
pnpm run supabase:reset
```

### Check Supabase Status

Displays the current status of the local Supabase services.

```
pnpm run supabase:status
```

### Link Supabase Project

Links the local project to a remote Supabase project.

```
pnpm run supabase:link
```

### Generate Migration

```
pnpm run supabase:generate-migration
```

Creates a new migration file based on the differences between your local database and the current schema.

### Generate Seed Data

```
pnpm run supabase:generate-seed
```

Dumps the current database data to a seed file at `supabase/seed.sql`.

### Push Database Changes

```
pnpm run supabase:push
```

Applies local schema changes to the remote Supabase database.

### Pull Database Changes

```
pnpm run supabase:pull
```

Fetches the latest schema changes from the remote Supabase database to your local environment.
